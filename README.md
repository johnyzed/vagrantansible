Vagrant & Ansible
============

Just an exercise for myself to run and provision environment with Vagrant and Ansible:
* _Vagrant_ - VMs environment managing
* _Ansible_ - provisioning and configuration management

# Usage
1. Install Vagrant:
https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/

2. Install Ansible:
http://docs.ansible.com/intro_installation.html

3. Clone this repo:
``` 
git clone https://github.com/virtser/blogexersise.git
``` 

4. Create and provision environment:
``` 
vagrant up
```
